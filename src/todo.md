* Polygons
* Hit test
* Text.
* Tree-shake friendly
* Render to canvas
* Thick lines
* Export to SVG (done for wires. left line strip and points)
* ~~Game camera~~
* ~~Point cloud refactor (optimize colors)~~


## Ideas
* Game camera should be a mix of map camera and game camera. E.g. panzoom should work in that mode too.
* Use inertia/friction for the camera - makes it feel more natural?
