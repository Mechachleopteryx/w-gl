# w-gl

A simple renderer for 2d. I use this project to learn more about WebGL apps
architecture.

It was mostly inspired by [WebGL Insights](http://www.webglinsights.com/) book,
and ~~is not really meant to be a reusable library~~ I use it for most of my 2d webgl rendering. I should probably document this more.

You can find its application in these repositories:
