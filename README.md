# w-gl

A simple renderer for 2d. I use this project to learn more about WebGL apps
architecture.

It was mostly inspired by [WebGL Insights](http://www.webglinsights.com/) book,
and is not really meant to be a reusable library.

You can find its application in this repository: https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.path.demo
